# Simple fire effect with Pygame

This is a try to create a simple fire effect with Pygame, using an idea similar to cellular automata with some randomisation.
Made for fun, made from scratch - didn't do any research on how to create such effect, the goal is to figure it out on my own.

Very much WIP.
